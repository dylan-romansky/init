This project was our introduction to and crash course in networking. We were given a number of simple challanges where we located specific system files and/or  came up with commands that would find certain system and network information including but not limited to OS version, hostnames of public websites, and several details about the steps  that actually happen between a request being made and the information actually making it to your computer.
